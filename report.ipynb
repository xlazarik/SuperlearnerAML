    "When choosing the base learners for the first layer we have considered the properties of the dataset and the task in this case being binary classification. As the paper *Practical considerations for specifying a super learner* suggests \"An ideal, rich library is diverse in its learning strategies, able to adapt to a range of underlying functional forms for the true prediction function, computationally feasible, and effective at handling high dimensional data. Diverse libraries include parametric learners, highly data-adaptive learners, multiple variants of the same learner with different tuning parameter specifications...\". So the first layer should consist of diverse algorithms with different inductive biases to ensure a rich set of predictions for the metalearnerearner\".\n",
